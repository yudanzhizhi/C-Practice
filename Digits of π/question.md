On March 14, the day of the number π is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.    

Polycarp was told at school that the number π is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number π by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.     

Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered π as 3.1415, he wrote out 31415.     

Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number π Polycarp actually remembers correctly.

### Input  
The first line of the input data contains the single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>) — the number of test cases in the test.      

Each test case is described by a single string of digits n, which was written out by Polycarp.   

The string n contains up to 30 digits.

### Output
Output t integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number π Polycarp remembers correctly.
